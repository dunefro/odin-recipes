            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ small onion, chopped (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
            <p>
                Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
            <p>
                Sift flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Mix egg and oil into dry ingredients; stir in yeast mixture. When dough has pulled together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
            <p>
                Cook and stir diced tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, 1 tablespoon oregano, garlic, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sauce has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
            <p>
                Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a knife to divide dough into two equal pieces--do not tear. Shape dough into rounds and let rest for 10 minutes. Form dough into rectangles, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Spoon tomato sauce over dough. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese; top with bell pepper, onion, and mushroom. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over top.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
            <p>
                Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp and cheese has melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </p>
